# autism utopia

below is a way to build an autism utopia step by step. the prompt is wrapped into text block. user might use that one by one to chat with deepseek without thinking enabled to reproduce the result.


```text
I'm autism.

let's build social rules formally using second or higher order logic.

1. nobody can teach an autism like me, and i can teach nobody. other autism may have that ability to teach but never being taught by an non-autism. (treat autism as a property).
2. if tom helps alice one time, alice get a dept counting of one. so does alice, and every agent.
3. each agent has a dept counting accumulator for every other agents using ordinals. when the accumulator is full-filled (the agent forget the exact counting), it turns into omega. then omega + 1, ...
4. there exists a parameter for society called average helping value by one time, measured by money. this serves as a minimal currency amount (rather than legal one) and can pay dept immediately.
5. for fundamental sequence of omega, the helper set the price to make every dept decreasable towards zero.

```

```text

```

```text
