# autism utopia

below is a way to build an autism utopia step by step. the prompt is wrapped into text block. user might use that one by one to chat with deepseek without thinking enabled to reproduce the result.


```text
I'm autism.

let's build social rules formally using second or higher order logic.

1. nobody can teach an autism like me, and i can teach nobody. other autism may have that ability to teach but never being taught by an non-autism. (treat autism as a property).
2. if tom helps alice one time, alice get a dept counting of one. so does alice, and every agent.
3. each agent has a dept counting accumulator for every other agents using ordinals. when the accumulator is full-filled (the agent forget the exact counting), it turns into ω. then ω + 1, ... ε₀, ...
4. there exists a parameter for society called average helping value by one time, measured by money. this serves as a minimal currency amount (rather than legal one) and can pay dept immediately.
5. for fundamental sequence of any countable transfinite ordinal, the helper set the price to make every dept decreasable towards zero. for uncountable transfinite ordinal, it still works but never reaches zero.

```text
good. let's define teacher as someone with the ability to teach every agent except me. 
```

```text
good. let's define hired state as agent has transfinite debt.
```

```text
good. let's define payment cycle as two agents keep dept to each other, one must be finite, one must be transfinite.
```

```text
good. let's define company as agent does business by hiring and teaches employees.
```

```text
good. let's define week government as agent that cannot be hired by anyone.
```

```text
good. let's define government as week government that cannot be company.
```

```text
good. let's define slave: with uncountable debt, ω_1
```

```text
good. now let's introduce epstemic logic by agency;
every kid is an agent if they believe they are. every adult is an agent and they know they are.
```

```text
good. let's talk further;
for every being, no matter they are agent or not, if they know something they must believe it; for agents, if they believe, they know, thus creating falsy knowledges to protect themselves.
```
